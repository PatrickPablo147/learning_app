      "\n\n What is Software Requirements?"
      "\nRequirements are the description of what the system should do, or services that it provides and the constraints on its operation."
      "\n\n IEEE "
      "\nDefines requirements as (1) a condition or capability needed by a user to solve problem or achieve an objective."
      "\nA condition or capability that must be met or possessed by a system or system component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed documents."
      "\nA documented representation of a condition or capability as in 1 or 2."
      "\n\nThe Role of Cybersecurity in FinTech"
      "\n-Sentences and paragraphs should be short and written in active voice. Also, proper grammar, spelling, punctuation should be used."
      "\n-Conjunctions such as “and” and ”or” should be avoided as they indicated the combination of several requirements in one requirements."
      "\n-Each requirements should be stated only once so that it does not create redundancy in the requirements specification documents."

      "\n• Is a stage in software engineering in which a blueprint is created to serve as the foundation for building the software system."
      "\n• IEEE defines software design as ‘both a process of defining the architecture, components, interfaces, and other characteristics of a system or component and the result of that process.’"
      "\n\nSOFTWARE DESIGN CONCEPT"
      "\n• Every software process is characterized by basic concepts along with certain practices or methods."
      "\n• is a powerful design tool that allows software designers to consider components at an abstract level while ignoring implementation details."
      "\n• IEEE defines abstraction as 'a view of a problem that extracts the essential information relevant to a particular purpose and ignores the remainder of the information.’"
      "\n\nThe concept of abstraction can be used in two ways:"
      "\n1. PROCESS"
      "\n• It refers to a system for hiding irrelevant information."
      "\n2. ENTITY"
      "\n• it refers to a model or view of an item."
